# Reproduction of the code of the paper "FISTA algorithm: so fast ?" by G. Fort, L. Risser, Y. Atchad√© and E. Moulines
Authors: Mathis Scheffler and Constantin Vaillant-Tenzer

Implementation using (or alternatively not) JAX of the pertubated FISTA and gradient descent algorithm to solve an arg-minimisation problem.

## How to Run the Code

To generate the video from our code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/cvt8/fista_sofast.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `$ cd fista_sofast` (for Linux users)
3. Create a new Python environment: `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. Activate the conda environment: `$ conda activate fista`

### Regular version

5. Run the code: `$ python fista_use_paper.py`
5. (bis) alternatively you can use slurm: `$ sbatch laucha_fista.sh`

### If you want to use JAX
JAX makes a (slightly) faster implementation by using processor paralelisation.

5. Run the code: `$ python fista_use_paper_jax.py`
5. (bis) alternatively you can use slurm: `$ sbatch laucha_fista_jax.sh`

## Possible improvements

As the code take hours (even days) to run, using C instead of python would dramatically increase the compting speed (about 87 times for the pi-decimals benchmark: https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison).
